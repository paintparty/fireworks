## Primary goals for Fireworks, Q3 2025


### Editor Integrations
Publish Fireworks editor plugins/extensions/integrations for the following:
VS Code
[Completed](https://github.com/paintparty/fireworks/blob/main/docs/editors/vscode/vscode.md)

Cursive / IntelliJ
[Completed](https://github.com/paintparty/fireworks/blob/main/docs/editors/cursive/cursive.md)

Emacs
In progress. Work on this will commence and once a sufficient amount of data from the use of the Joyride and Cursive implementations is gathered. This will inform any unforeseen details about the ergonomics or implementation details.



### Automatic color support detection
Add support for automatic detection of the 3 levels of color support (16-color, 256-color, or Truecolor), using an approach similar to [Chalk](https://github.com/chalk/supports-color).<br>[#42](https://github.com/paintparty/fireworks/issues/42)
[Completed](https://github.com/paintparty/fireworks/pull/76)

### Documentation of interactive workflow. 
Produce written and/or video documentation a live hot-reloading dev environment for JVM Clojure, powered by Fireworks and Bling:
  - [`deps.edn` sample project](https://github.com/paintparty/fireworks?tab=readme-ov-file#jvm-clojure-deps-setup) 
  - [`Leiningen` sample project](https://github.com/paintparty/fireworks?tab=readme-ov-file#jvm-clojure-leiningen-setup)

### Enhanced documentation for theme creation. 
Produce written and/or video documentation that makes it easier for people to create their own themes to suite their tastes.

### Call-site options for quick formatting changes.
For hifi printing, support call-site option to disable all truncation and ellipsis

## Secondary goals for Fireworks, Q3 2025

### Flag for eliding truncation and ellipsis at callsite
`(? :+ my-coll)`, as shorthand for (? {:truncation? false} my-coll).<br>
[#77](https://github.com/paintparty/fireworks/issues/77)
[Completed](https://github.com/paintparty/fireworks/pull/77)

### Option for changing label color at callsite
Allow for quick call-site changes to the label color for Fireworks output.<br>[#53](https://github.com/paintparty/fireworks/issues/53)
[Completed](https://github.com/paintparty/fireworks/pull/76)

### Support bold output
Allow for quick call-site changes to the produce bold Fireworks output.<br>[#70](https://github.com/paintparty/fireworks/issues/70)
[Completed](https://github.com/paintparty/fireworks/pull/76)

Add option to format the label as code. #82
[Completed](https://github.com/paintparty/fireworks/pull/82)

Add function to set options programmatically #81
[Completed](https://github.com/paintparty/fireworks/pull/81)

### Pipeline for cljs browser console printing
Hifi output with Fireworks works just fine for printing to a browser dev console. Post-processing ansi-tagged output for browser console printing, would, however, be a big improvement vs the current implementation.

### Support for native JS sets and maps in CLJS
When hifi printing, properly display contents of JS Sets and Maps, when they are within a native cljs data structure.<br>[#46](https://github.com/paintparty/fireworks/issues/46) [Completed](https://github.com/paintparty/fireworks/pull/86)  

### Map layout flexibility
For hifi printing, support call-site option to force single-column map layout a la carte. This is sometimes preferable when map contains keys or values that are long strings.<br>[#45](https://github.com/paintparty/fireworks/issues/45)

### Generate distinct test suite for ClojureScript 
Coverage for brower-based cljs output is currently minimal.<br>[#64](https://github.com/paintparty/fireworks/issues/64)

### Trace mode
Support a `:trace` mode with `fireworks.core/?` debugging macro.<br>[#23](https://github.com/paintparty/fireworks/issues/23)
